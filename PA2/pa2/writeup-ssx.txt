1. Platform:    Platform: Linux
                The version: Linux 2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64 x86_64 (Coming from command uname -mrs)

2. In the folder, there are 5 files:    ltga.cpp, ltga.h -- support code from Lab1
                                        P2PSearch.cpp
                                        Makefile
                                        writeup-ssx.txt
    When typing command make to compile, the execution program is named P2PSearch
3.  This assignment helps to have a better understanding of the mechanism of P2P network.
    However, I don't think integrating OpenGL is very helpful for the project idea and also it brings some extra difficulties on our programming
